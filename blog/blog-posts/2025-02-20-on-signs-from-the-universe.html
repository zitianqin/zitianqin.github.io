      <h3>Part 1: Dreams</h3>
      <p>
        I've been thinking quite a bit about signs from the universe recently.
        Ever since reading and finishing Coelho's <i>The Alchemist</i>, I've
        been reflecting a lot more on the things that have happened to me in the
        past.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always wanted to start a startup and build my own things — things
        that I would find helpful and that others will hopefully also find
        helpful. That was actually the reason why I decided to study Computer
        Science in the first place. I could have taken a safe route with an
        accounting scholarship, but I had dreams much greater than working in a
        firm filling out spreadsheets and balancing inflows and outflows. I
        chose to study Computer Science to follow my dreams in being able to
        create the things I want to create, and to understand the universe
        better, over short-term job security and monetary gain. Though I use to
        occasionally have doubts about this decision, looking back, I definitely
        made the right one.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times however, we lose sight of our dreams. It's too easy to be
        caught in the day-to-day momentum of things, and just do what everyone
        else is doing, or what is expected of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is everyone else grinding out LeetCode problems? I guess I'll do the
        same then. Is everyone else trying to get into a quantitative trading
        firm? I guess I'll do the same then. Is everyone else trying to figure
        out how to maximise their chances of getting offers to work at companies
        where they'll probably be working at for the rest of their lives? I
        guess I'll do that as well then.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem obviously becomes that at a certain point, we lose track of
        what we actually want to do. What we want to achieve. We begin to forget
        about our dreams, our aspirations that make us unique, and the things
        that we actually care about. Before long, the things that we end up
        caring about just becomes what everyone else cares about, while all the
        dreams and aspirations we had when we were younger slowly become
        forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, I know that my end goal is to create something myself that I
        can be truly proud of. Something that has very real and measurable
        impact on people. How I get there is more flexible. If working a few
        years at a tech company to build the skills necessary is the way there,
        then I will do that, but we must not become preoccupied with thinking
        that it's the only way there. We also have to question whether the path
        that everyone else is taking is the right path for us, as everyone has
        different dreams. In many instances, people have already forgotten what
        their dreams are, and are just following the herd.
      </p>
      <h3>Part 2: Signs</h3>
      <p>
        I think the universe works in strange ways. Everything that happens
        happens for a reason, and there is always a message that the universe is
        bringing. It's your job to interpret it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, I've had a series of events occurring that seem like
        setbacks hindering my progress, making me fall behind. But upon
        reflection, I have realised that I haven't fallen behind in following my
        dream — I've only fallen behind in following the dreams of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn't get a job offer? That's probably a sign that it would have
        distracted me and I'd be better off focusing on my startup. Didn't get
        an internship? I'll learn a lot faster working on a startup anyways.
        Didn't get a scholarship? It would have made me complacent and led me to
        a corporate job, making me forget about my dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these things would have hurt the goals of the herd — to get a
        corporate job that they'll be working in for the rest of their lives.
        But all those seemingly unfortunate events actually accelerated my
        progress towards my own dream. If I did get a job offer, internship, or
        scholarship, I'd likely get complacent enough to forget about my dreams
        and eventually die of regret. Sometimes seemingly unfortunate events are
        blessings made by the universe in disguise. It just depends on what your
        true dreams are. And of course, everyone's dreams are different. Whether
        you want to take care of your family, help starving children, or explore
        space, there will always be a period in your life where the universe
        begs you to follow your dreams. It'll give you signs, gentle — and
        sometimes hard — prods in the right direction. But if you ignore the
        signs for too long, you'll end up forgetting about your dreams. And when
        you're old, the universe will remind you of your dreams again, and at
        that point your dreams will remain dreams forever.
