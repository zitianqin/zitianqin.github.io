## Part 1: Dreams

I've been thinking quite a bit about signs from the universe recently.
Ever since reading and finishing Coelho's *The Alchemist*, I've
been reflecting a lot more on the things that have happened to me in
the past.

I've always wanted to start a startup and build my own things — things
that I would find helpful and that others will hopefully also find
helpful. That was actually the reason why I decided to study Computer
Science in the first place. I could have taken a safe route with an
accounting scholarship, but I had dreams much greater than working in
a firm filling out spreadsheets and balancing inflows and outflows. I
chose to study Computer Science to follow my dreams in being able to
create the things I want to create, and to understand the universe
better, over short-term job security and monetary gain. Though I use
to occasionally have doubts about this decision, looking back, I
definitely made the right one.

At times however, we lose sight of our dreams. It's too easy to be
caught in the day-to-day momentum of things, and just do what everyone
else is doing, or what is expected of you.

Is everyone else grinding out LeetCode problems? I guess I'll do the
same then. Is everyone else trying to get into a quantitative trading
firm? I guess I'll do the same then. Is everyone else trying to figure
out how to maximise their chances of getting offers to work at
companies where they'll probably be working at for the rest of their
lives? I guess I'll do that as well then.

The problem obviously becomes that at a certain point, we lose track
of what we actually want to do. What we want to achieve. We begin to
forget about our dreams, our aspirations that make us unique, and the
things that we actually care about. Before long, the things that we
end up caring about just becomes what everyone else cares about, while
all the dreams and aspirations we had when we were younger slowly
become forgotten.

In my case, I know that my end goal is to create something myself that
I can be truly proud of. Something that has very real and measurable
impact on people. How I get there is more flexible. If working a few
years at a tech company to build the skills necessary is the way
there, then I will do that, but we must not become preoccupied with
thinking that it's the only way there. We also have to question
whether the path that everyone else is taking is the right path for
us, as everyone has different dreams. In many instances, people have
already forgotten what their dreams are, and are just following the
herd.

## Part 2: Signs

I think the universe works in strange ways. Everything that happens
happens for a reason, and there is always a message that the universe
is bringing. It's your job to interpret it.

In my case, I've had a series of events occurring that seem like
setbacks hindering my progress, making me fall behind. But upon
reflection, I have realised that I haven't fallen behind in following
my dream — I've only fallen behind in following the dreams of others.

Didn't get a job offer? That's probably a sign that it would have
distracted me and I'd be better off focusing on my startup. Didn't get
an internship? I'll learn a lot faster working on a startup anyways.
Didn't get a scholarship? It would have made me complacent and led me
to a corporate job, making me forget about my dreams.

All of these things would have hurt the goals of the herd — to get a
corporate job that they'll be working in for the rest of their lives.
But all those seemingly unfortunate events actually accelerated my
progress towards my own dream. If I did get a job offer, internship,
or scholarship, I'd likely get complacent enough to forget about my
dreams and eventually die of regret. Sometimes seemingly unfortunate
events are blessings made by the universe in disguise. It just depends
on what your true dreams are. And of course, everyone's dreams are
different. Whether you want to take care of your family, help starving
children, or explore space, there will always be a period in your life
where the universe begs you to follow your dreams. It'll give you
signs, gentle — and sometimes hard — prods in the right direction. But
if you ignore the signs for too long, you'll end up forgetting about
your dreams. And when you're old, the universe will remind you of your
dreams again, and at that point your dreams will remain dreams
forever.
